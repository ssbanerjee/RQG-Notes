The gods commonly known as [[The Old Gods]], turned their backs on their creations and left them in a new dark age, causing the [[Severance]]. With magic ripped from the world, [[The Old Gods]] now believe the mortals of this plane will no longer challenge their authority and will once again become submissive followers of their edicts.

With the loss of magic and the severance to the weave, the mortal races of Vahlenar turned to the world around them in an attempt to salve their wounds, and bring good fortune to their lives. Over the years following the war of the ancients the people of Vahlenar shaped a new religion that underpins their daily lives, creating [[The New Gods]].

There are many within the world of Vahlenar who have turned their back on religion, and the gods, and now pray to the natural world that surrounds them. These gods are nameless and numerous. The free folk, the name given to themselves by those who worship in this way, believe that the gods are everywhere—in the rocks, streams, birds, and beasts—and that they take the deceased down into the earth and trees. These are known as [[The Nameless Gods]]
