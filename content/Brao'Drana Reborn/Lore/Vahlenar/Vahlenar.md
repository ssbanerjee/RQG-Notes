Vahlenar is a realm steeped in myth and legend, where elves, dwarves, humans, and other fantastical beings have shaped its destiny over the last twenty five years of the fourth age.

### **The Birth of Vahlenar**
[[Vahlenar]] emerged from the depths of chaos. The [[Severance]] caused the ancient magical ley lines that were woven into lands of Brao’Drana to completely reshape the ancient lands of this world into new forms. [[Vahlenar]] was born during this magical upheaval.

In the beginning the land was inhabited by elves, dwarves, and humans among other beings of the mortal plane. For much of its early history post severance the mortal races were able to cooperate in building a new world from the ashes of the old. Diplomacy and statesmanship allowed for the charismatic and courageous leaders of these peoples to come together in peace as they looked to rebuild.

However, as is often the case in times of chaos, powerful dark forces looked to gain ground in the hearts of men. The demon lord [[Graz’zt]] took on the guise of a courtesan in the high court of the human king [[Delethor]]. Here, he poured his wickedness and venom into his mind, corrupting [[Delethor]] to the darkness that lies in all mens hearts. It was through the demon lord that [[Delethor]] was shown dark magic, held by the demons of the material plane, and offered it to him. [[Delethor]], already corrupted by the demon lord, accepted the dark magic into his heart and was corrupted further. His physical features began to change as his body withered and decayed along with his mind. He lost all sense of self, and of duty, and was reborn as [[Malgathor]], the dark one.

Like any infection, the dark magic of [[Malgathor]] began to spread through the humans of [[Vahlenar]] who lived in or around the capital city of [[Galehead]]. Other dark creatures took root in the woods around the cursed city and continue to live there today haunting the roads, and depths, of the forest. All around [[Malgathor]] armies of darkness began to rise as the humans of [[Vahlenar]] waged war against their neighbors for total control of the continent.

[[Malgathor]] sought to wield the forbidden powers to conquer all of [[Vahlenar]]. As his dark army spread like a shadow across the continent, a grand alliance was forged among Elves, Dwarves, and the noble Humans who rejected [[Malgathor|Malgathor's]] tyranny. This led to the [[The War of the Darkening]].
