Following the war of the ancients the elemental lords were banished back to their respective realms and imprisoned there by the gods. The vanquished gods are: Elohir, the Earth warden; Grill, the Water warden; Calahron, the Fire warden; Norgalon, the Air warden

The Vanquished are held in high regard by shamans and some druids. While the Vanquished have been exiled to their realms their influence on the material plane should not be dismissed as they are irrevocably connected to the natural world of Braoâ€™Drana.
