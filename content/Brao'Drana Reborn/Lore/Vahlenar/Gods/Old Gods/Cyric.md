The God of Death, and Deception. Cyric prays on the weakness of mortal races and seeks to influence the lives of those on the material plan through deception and fear. Many believe that he was behind the summoning of Mizzerene from the fey realm and was using it as a way to take power from Tyr. 

Cyric, also referred to commonly as, “The Shadow” is represented by the symbol of a black skull on a red background.
