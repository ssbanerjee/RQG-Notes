The god of fate, also known as the fate weaver, is a figure shrouded in mystery among the pantheon of the nine. He is often depicted as a figure who, unconcerned with the gods' petty jealousy, seems consumed by the lives of mortals. He is often disguised as a traveling old man who walks the road in gray traveling robes. 

Nerull is represented by a gnarled oak emblazoned on a white background.
