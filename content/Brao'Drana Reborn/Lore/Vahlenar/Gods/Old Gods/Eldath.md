Goddess of Peace, is the god who in the fourth age, has the highest number of cult followers. Many of the followers of Eldath hope for the return of the long peace, and the knowledge of the arcane, along with hopes of an end to the many wars and the violence seen throughout the realm as mortal races battle for power.
