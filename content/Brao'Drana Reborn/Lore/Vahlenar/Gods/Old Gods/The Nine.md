Even though the war of the ancients severed the relationship between the gods and the mortal races there are still cults that follow them and seek their approval and favor. The nine will sometimes answer the prayers of their most loyal followers but it has been years since any have been able to divine with them. The cultâ€™s words are found below:

- [[Tyr]]
- [[Cyric]]
- [[Hextor]]
- [[Nerull]]
- [[Reynard]]
- [[Savras]]
- [[Eldath]]
- [[Tritherion]]
- [[Boccab Oghma]]
