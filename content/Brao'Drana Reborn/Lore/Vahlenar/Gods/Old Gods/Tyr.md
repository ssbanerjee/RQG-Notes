The god of Justice, and Life. Tyr is the leading figure among the gods and while the gods tend to work things out in a semi-democratic manner, he is often the de facto leader. 

Tyr, who’s also known simply as “The Light,” is represented by the symbol of a white owl, often shown against a light blue background, holding a bundle of Elys Vine in the right claw.
