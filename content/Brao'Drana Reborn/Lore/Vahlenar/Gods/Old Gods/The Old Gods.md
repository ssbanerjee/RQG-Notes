### The Nine
[[The Nine]] reside in the divine plane but are active in the material plane in their avatar forms. The gods will often come to earth and enjoy placing themselves in the middle of mortal lives. They are very mortal in their emotions and feel the full range from love to hate, jealousy to lust, and passion to anger. They often are victims of their emotions and can be embroiled in the affairs of mortals.

### The Vanquished

### The Dragonlords
[[The Dragonlords]] are the few remaining metallic dragons in the world.
