God of War. The cults of Hextor are often filled with warriors, mercenaries, and some barbarians. Hextor is the representation of the violence and bloodshed of battle and all who follow him seek the glorious death. When a member of the cult of Hextor dies it is believed their death is judged by the god of war himself, and those found unworthy must fight for their life beyond the veil.
