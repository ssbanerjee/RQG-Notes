God of Justice and the divine of Paladins throughout Braoâ€™Drana. Depicted as blindfolded while holding their sword and shield, Savras is a being who rarely intervenes on the mortal plane. Justice, as Savras has said before, is a very nebulous concept and is often seen differently by those on opposing sides.

Their symbol is the scale or the sword, both being worn interchangeably by the Paladins who swear their oaths to them.
