The Raven is the god of death, and the afterlife, and is rarely prayed to by the common folk of Vahlenar. The only times the name of the Raven is evoked is upon death or at a loved ones funeral. Ravens are seen as ill omens in the world and though they are not believed to be evil by the Vahler they are not welcome creatures.
