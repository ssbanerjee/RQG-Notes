The Traveler is a symbol for the unknown and unpredictable nature of life in the new world. Horizons are expanded and the world lies ahead of all those who survived the severance. The Traveler is represented as a figure wearing a traveling cloak, carrying a walking staff, and often wearing a traveling pack.
