The [[Age of Reconciliation]] was short lived, however, with the [[Last Alliance]] holding together the lands of Vahlenar for only two years after the end of The War of the Darkening. For there were forces at work that sought to unravel the peace of the land

The seals that bound Malgathor in the dark prison were weakening over time, as all binding magic weathers with time, and with the weakening of the seal his malice and hate spilled back into the world. Like a venom it poisoned the minds of weaker men. Moving quickly, this new darkness began to spread across the world, placing hatred and fear in the hearts and souls of those it seduced. 

Before long this fear led to a growing mistrust between the leaders of the [[Last Alliance]]. There were no formal wars, or battles, but the shadow campaigns waged by the various factions within the lands of Vahlenar led to the breaking of the [[Last Alliance]] and the beginning of a standing cold war among the more powerful factions, all of whom were seeking dominion over the land and people.
