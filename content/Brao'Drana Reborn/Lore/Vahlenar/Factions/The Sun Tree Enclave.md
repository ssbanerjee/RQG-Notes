The druids of Vahlenar believe that the weave and its magical influence on the world is connected to the nature that they work to protect. Their work in the wild places of this world seeks to reconnect the weave by interacting with the nameless gods and primordial forces that have shaped the world since before the severance. 

The grove menders, as they are called, maintain groves deep within the forest realms throughout the world. It is here that the druids and their allies seek out knowledge while communing with the natural world.
