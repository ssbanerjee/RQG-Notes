The **Long Patrol** is a specialized elite army of warriors that reside at the fortress city of [[Belohck]]. They're led by the resident regent champion of the mountain fortress, [[Lord Brocktree]].

The warriors of the **Long Patrol** are perilous in battle and feared by dark forces everywhere. Though they are occasionally lazy and almost always eat a lot, the warriors are good creatures whose goal is to rid the land of evil.
