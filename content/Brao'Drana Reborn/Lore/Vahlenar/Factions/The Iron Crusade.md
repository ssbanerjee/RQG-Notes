The iron crusade seeks to eradicate all those who seek out magic, or attempt to wield it, believing that this will prolong the gods' anger at the mortal races. The Iron Crusade and their armies of zealots travel throughout the land hunting down rumors of magic users and those who seek it out. It is their belief that by denying the use of magic to everyone that they will earn the godâ€™s trust once again and in doing so, be rewarded for their faith and belief. 

The members of the Iron Crusade wear no uniforms, and carry no banner, but their members are marked by the iron ring they wear around their neck, and the ==nine pointed star== branded into their chest.
