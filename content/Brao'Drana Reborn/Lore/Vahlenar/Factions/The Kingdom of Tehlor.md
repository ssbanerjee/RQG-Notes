The Kingdom is ruled over by [[Grauman Melling]], the son of Tehlor Melling, who established the kingdom at the beginning of the Severance. The elder Melling died during the War of the Darkening, followed in the line of thrones by his eldest son, Reiner. The new king is an ambitious but fair ruler who controls all of the lands east of the Sword Hills. 

The Kingdom of Tehlor lives a peaceful existence east of the mountains that protect their homelands. The small towns and villages that dot its shores support the capital city of [[Deloran]] and the lively economy found within its markets. The southern coast of the kingdom is home to the free city of [[Nalâ€™Dorei]].
