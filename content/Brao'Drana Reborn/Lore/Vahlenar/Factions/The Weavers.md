The weavers are a group that seeks the return of magic to the world by whatever means necessary. They call no one place home in Vahlenar, instead wandering throughout the world, establishing footholds from which they seek powerful artifacts, knowledge, and treasures that will allow them to learn more regarding the return to a time of arcana.
