*LM Note: Apologies for the lack of information.
The recording I wanted to use to take notes ended up not working out so I can only go off memory this time.*

Tacetus and DaVinci go to tank the boss, taking a lot of damage and getting knocked out in turns. Dex blinds themselves and everyone around them for a time, but makes Hattie invisible to sneak up on the boss and land massive hits. Brusay continues to shoot the boss from afar, whereas Vino uses the last of her heals trying to save the two warriors. Meanwhile Anjali casts one spell and immediately gets turned into a sheep for the entire combat. Eventually the group wins (hooray)
