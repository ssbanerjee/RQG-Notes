*LM Note: Apologies for the lack of information.
The recording I wanted to use to take notes ended up not working out so I can only go off memory this time.*
^LMNote

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] is immediately grabbed by a Roper lurking in the water and within 6 seconds has his head bashed into the ground and tossed into the water.
During the hard fight against the Roper which is proving to be extremely difficult to hit, [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] notices a couple small kobolds stroll into the room and decides nothing was more important at that time than immediately eldritch blasting one of them into non-existence. Tragically, the remaining kobold yells out "STEVE!!!" in despair.
