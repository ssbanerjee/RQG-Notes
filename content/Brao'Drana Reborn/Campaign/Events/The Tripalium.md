  - Hiring Fair
---
A yearly summer event in [[Whiteshore]] during which all sorts of folk gather near the town looking for work as guards, miners, farmhands, guides, or other unskilled laborers. For the most part, those who attend this fair are brutes, bandits, or freeholders whose lands can no longer sustain them, but occasionally, a strong hand or a skilled warrior can be culled from the bunch. While this event is going on, [[Whiteshore]] is overrun with visitors it would rather not welcome, who steal goods, sell wares in the street (sometimes those they have just stolen), meet unscrupulous contacts to hand off coin, information, or purloined items, and engage in the occasional duel. Itâ€™s quite common for a new adventuring company to come into being at one of these fairs, when those who stand out from the crowd because they have legitimate skills to sell gravitate toward one another and decide to form a group.
