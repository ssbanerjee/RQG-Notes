## Log
We get to Skyde, lively town
Smells of food throughout
Thriving market, multi-culture
Close-knit community
Democracy
Gnomes run the town

Sunset, we are approaching town
Thorn & Petal, famous tavern
Makers Row, shop street
Penelope, driver of market cart
Not a super glamorous place, being a trade route town (one road)
Large two story building at the end, timber and stone
Flower woven throughout the thatch roof
Beautifully carved door

In the Inn:
Pebble Hopfoot, doorman
Long Patrol like to get super rowdy
(Eugene only): door was a gift from the Builders, to the grandfather of Pebble
Raven fixes Lar's flute, made from an ancient magical tree that no longer exists.
Lar plays a beautiful melody in thanks, invoking wonderful memories of a past forgotten
Local bard: Harmony Hopfoot
(Eugene only): Observes stone tower; Temple of the Nine. Somehow survived the Sundering. Folks with beige robes similar to Elfric are at the tower. One is a human female with bright blue eyes. Sister of the Nine. It "called" her here, believing the Nine are still around. Nine point red star gem necklace.
(Yenna only): Attempting to steal from a drunk man
