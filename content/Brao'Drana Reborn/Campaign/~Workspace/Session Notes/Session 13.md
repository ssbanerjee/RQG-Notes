> [!Summary] Session Summary
> The [[B05 - Kobold Cave|fight against the Kobolds]] kicks off with a surprise round for the Kobolds as they ambush the stealth group of the party, dealing a large amount of damage. [[Anjali]] rushes in to protect the kids from further harm, healing one of them in the process, while [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] also comes in, healing the others for a massive amount of health. Unfortunately, due to their panic, [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] retaliates to the sudden attack by using Thunderclap, damaging everyone around them, namely being the stealth group and [[Anjali]] who had just ran in to defend them. To further add to the chaos, [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] decides to fire an arrow into the narrow hallway filled with allies who are blocking the enemies from view. Unfortunately, they Crit fail, and [[Anjali]] finds an arrow shot into his ass. This sudden shock awakes [[Anjali]] abilities, and he suddenly adapts a [[Anjali#Starry Form|Starry Form]], becoming stronger. [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] also is able to cast magic, however this back fires as a Wild Magic surge causes them to grow massively in size, to the point where they're now covering the entrance to the cave.
> After some more rounds of combat, the group manages to defeat the remaining Kobolds and are now left pondering how to advance.
