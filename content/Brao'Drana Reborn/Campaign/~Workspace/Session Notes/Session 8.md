> [!Summary] Session Summary
> The group continues to argue as war drums thump and torches in the night quickly close the distance. A group of wargs break through the clearing and dash towards the group. [[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] boldly charges in headfirst and grapples a wolf to the ground, kicking off the battle. Despite best efforts, the group is unable to dispatch of the wargs quickly, and they look on in dismay as squads of goblin archers and soldiers join the battle in waves. [[Raven Eléfont|Raven]] begins to make a retreat as the battle turns grim, initially joined by the two bards. However, as allies begin to fall, [[Larimar Laguna|Lar]] and [[Spudris Shadowsong|Spud]] make a final attempt to return to battle to aid their comrades. Unfortunately, none are spared, and most of the group is incapacitated. By the time the battle ends, [[Thorvald Einarsson]], [[Eugene Marchent]], [[Drew Saint Werd]], and [[Kira]], have all passed away. [[Yenna]], [[Larimar Laguna|Lar]], and [[Spudris Shadowsong|Spud]] have managed to avoid immediate death, but remain trapped in the goblin camp. Only [[Raven Eléfont|Raven]] successfully escapes the battle as he seeks out assistance.
