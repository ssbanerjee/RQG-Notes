> [!Summary] Session Summary
> The group is faced with a puzzle to enter the Kobold lair, which [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] resolves by dragging the cold, dead bodies of the Kobolds onto a pressure plate to keep the door open. As they venture in and [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] goes to scout ahead. Unfortunately he is immediately grabbed by a [[B06.1 - Roper|Roper]] lurking in the water and within 6 seconds has his head bashed into the ground and tossed into the water. During the hard fight against the [[B06.1 - Roper|Roper]], which is proving to be extremely difficult to hit, [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] notices a couple small kobolds stroll into the room and decides nothing was more important at that time than to immediately eldritch blast one of them into non-existence. Tragically, the remaining kobold yells out "STEVE!!!" in despair.
> 
> Proceeding past the room with the Roper, the group comes across a living quarters of sorts, where they discover information about [[Bertrand Jackson]], a renowned explorer who makes maps of caves and coasts.
> 
> The group enters the next room which consisted of a half dozen kobolds, surrounding a camp fire talking about bringing offerings to [[Kol'Tolmac]]. After listening long enough to get the information they wanted, the group then ambushes the kobolds and kill them all.
> 
> In the next room of Kobolds, [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] switches tactics and announces himself as an emissary of Kul'Tirok. Considering the name wasn't correct, a Kobold named [[BizBob]] is not convinced, however [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] soon scares them shitless into obedience. After asking where their supervisor is, [[Bizbob]] states that it was Steve, however they don't know where he is.  Brusay puts [[BizBob]] in charge instead and begins to drill into him. Meanwhile, [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] forces the rest of the Kobolds to remove their weapons for "inspection". After learning of where [[Kol'Tolmac]] resides, the group leaves to go into their lair after instructing the Kobolds to stand still, staring at the wall. In the final room, there is a giant crab-like creature, attended to by two guards. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] starts a conversation with one of the guards, but then immediately shanks them mid sentence, starting a fight.
> 
> [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] and [[DaVinci]] go to tank the boss, taking a lot of damage and getting knocked out in turns. [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] blinds themselves and everyone around them for a time, but makes [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] invisible to sneak up on the boss and land massive hits. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] continues to shoot the boss from afar, whereas [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] uses the last of her heals trying to save the two warriors. Meanwhile [[Anjali]] casts one spell and immediately gets turned into a sheep for the entire combat. Eventually the group wins (hooray).

## Log

*LM Note: Apologies for the lack of information.
The recording I wanted to use to take notes ended up not working out so I can only go off memory this time.*

[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] wants to fart.
*↑ LM Note: Gonna be real. I don't know why I wrote that, but apparently it warranted a log entry, lmao*

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] attempts to recall the religion of the Kobolds, but is unable to place it.
[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] chimes in, saying that when they were disconnected from their prime deities, they reorganized to regional gods.

[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] smashes the poor dragon statue to pieces.

[[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] investigates the statue and notices Draconic writing. [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] interprets it as "Many Needed". [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] jumps on the square plate, with no luck. The group gathers together to stand on top of the plate and the statue lifts, revealing a hidden path. The statue lowers again when the group steps off, so the gather the bodies of the cold, dead, Kobolds and stack them on the plate to apply the necessary weight.

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] places some sticks underneath the lifted statue, thinking it will hold it up well (rolled a 1 on Investigation)
The group ventures forward, with [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] leading the way.
___

[[B06.1 - Roper]]

![[B06.1 - Roper#^Summary]]

___

*LM Note: I believe I had to step out to get the pizza at the time, but the group defeats the Roper and then goes into like a living quarters area? Most of what happened here I don't have, other than someone saying they found out Steve is just a family man, lol*

Proceeding past the room with the Roper, the group comes across a living quarters of sorts, where they discover information about [[Bertrand Jackson]], a renowned explorer who makes maps of caves and coasts.

___

[[B06.2 - More Kobolds]]

![[B06.2 - More Kobolds#^Summary]]

___

The group enters the next room and finds another one filled with more Kobolds.
Not wanting to waste more resources, [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] announces himself as an emissary of [[Kol'Tolmac]] (actually he said Kul'Tirok), here to evaluate the Kobolds and asks where their supervisor is.  A Kobold named [[BizBob]] steps up and says that the Kobold's name was Steve, but they haven't seen him in a while and don't know where he is. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] then designates [[BizBob]] as the new supervisor and begins drilling him with questions. When the Kobold was not extremely forward with their answers, [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] then scares the man shitless and essentially coerces him to do whatever they want. [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] forces the rest of the kobolds to remove their weapons for inspection, although does not know what to do with them

The group finds out [[Kol'Tolmac]] is lurking in the next cave. They go into that cave and [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] immediately shanks one of the two kobold guards mid-sentence.
___

[[B06.3 - Kol’Tolmac]]

![[B06.3 - Kol’Tolmac#^Summary]]

___

[[Kol'Tolmac]] falls to the ground as [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] defeats them, and now the group is left to tend to their wounds.
