> [!Summary] Session Summary
[[Jewel]] continues to try and persuade the group to rescue his crewmates that are trapped in a goblin camp. He drops information about a treasure called the [[Fallen Star]] that they have been looking for, and promises rewards and compensation in the form of free passage to [[Whiteshore]] in return for the group's assistance. Both [[Spudris Shadowsong|Spud]] and [[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] manage to persuade the group into helping [[Jewel]]. As the group approaches the camp, [[Yenna]] and [[Kira]] offer to scout ahead. Unfortunately, they are too distracted by their own conversion that they fail to notice a pit trap and fall in. The rest of the group, after some time, begin to get worried for their companions, especially after [[Jewel]] mentions that they neglected to inform them of potential traps. After making a distress call code, the group sets off to search for their companions. During this search, [[Jewel]], [[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]], and [[Larimar Laguna|Lar]] also fall into a pit, leaving [[Raven Eléfont|Raven]] and [[Thorvald Einarsson|Thorvald]] to get them out. [[Yenna]] and [[Kira]] manage to get themselves out of their pit and reconvene with the group once everyone is gathered again. Suddenly, [[Yenna]] catches the group by surprise and immediately begins to attack [[Jewel]], with [[Kira]] assisting her. Despite best efforts, the group is unable to stop the duo from knocking out [[Jewel]], and then proceed to descend into an argument over their actions. [[Raven Eléfont|Raven]] convinces the party that they need to get to safety first before continuing the conversation, but the group took to long to act before it was too late..

## Recap of last session

## Log
[[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] mentions that the [[Fallen Star]] is related to another item.
[[Jewel]] explains that it is a treasure that his group has been hunting for. The captain mentioned that it will guide them forward to what you desire most. They haven't found the [[Fallen Star|star]] after searching for over a decade. They have no idea what or where it is or what it looks like. They found a note mentioning a man in [[Whiteshore]]. [[Jewel]] notes that potentially the [[Fallen Star]] could be broken at the moment, who knows.
[[Jewel]] offers free passage to [[Whiteshore]]. 

> [!Success] [[Spudris Shadowsong|Spud]] persuaded the group to go help [[Jewel]].

 Part of the group notices tracks leading in one direction. Side note: apparently it rains so much that it hides all tracks.
> [!Quote] "[[Old gnomish woman#^quote|Keep your eyes open, the rain hides many secrets]]"

 Some of us notice a small bit of light, a flame or torch, moving across in front of us. [[Yenna]] and [[Kira]] scout ahead. [[Yenna]] questions [[Kira]] about the random flame outbursts [[Kira]] seemed to cause.
 
 > [!Success] [[Kira]] manages to deceive [[Yenna]] and throw her off.
 
 > [!Fail] [[Kira]] and [[Yenna]] both fall into a pit trap due to being distracted.
 
[[Kira]] tries to throw [[Yenna]] up out of the pit, but fails miserably.  Group decides to go and look for them after they don't show up after a while. We make a distress call to sound like an Owl if someone falls.

> [!Fail] [[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]], [[Larimar Laguna|Lar]], and [[Jewel]] all fall into a pit as well.

[[Raven Eléfont|Raven]] and [[Thorvald Einarsson|Thorvald]] go and get the others out the pits while [[Spudris Shadowsong|Spud]] goes towards voices he heard.

> [!Success] [[Raven Eléfont|Raven]] and [[Thorvald Einarsson|Thorvald]] manage to pull the group out of their pit traps.

 > [!Success] [[Yenna]] stabs her weapons into the earth and manages to climb out of her pit.
 > [[Kira]] gets out after her.
 
 [[Yenna]] stabs her weapons into the earth to use them as footholds to climb up the pit. She ties a rope and allows [[Kira]] to pull herself out as well. After everyone is out of their pit traps, the group reconvenes.
 
 > [!Danger] [[Yenna]] immediately attempts to kill [[Jewel]]. [[Kira]] joins on the effort.

> [!Failure] [[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] attempts to stop [[Yenna]], but fails to do so.

  > [!Warning] [[Kira]] gets the final hit, but chooses to knock [[Jewel]] unconcious.
  
> [!Success] [[Spudris Shadowsong|Spud]] casts Prestigitation to scare [[Yenna]] into stopping.
> [[Thorvald Einarsson|Thorvald]] and [[Raven Eléfont|Raven]] also intervene and stand in between [[Jewel]] and his attackers.

[[Kira]] offers to tie up [[Jewel]] and [[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] is against traveling with [[Yenna]].
[[Raven Eléfont|Raven]] manages to convince the group to leave the dangerous area before the groups get surrounded. However, [[Thorvald Einarsson|Thorvald]] notices dozens of torches have appeared.
