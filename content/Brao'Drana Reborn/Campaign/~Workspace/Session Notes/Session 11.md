> [!Summary] Session Summary
>  > The group spends their idle time since The Night™ utilizing their time in various ways. [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] earns gold and reputation for her [[Deck of Dynarths|deck]] reading services, becoming a favorite amongst travelers passing by and staying at the Inns. [[Anjali]] spends his time helping folks around town with various tasks and providing food for those who need it. [[The Long Patrol]] members continue to try and find new recruits, but without much success. Instead, they opt for also helping out the townsfolk with various tasks, such as saving trapped animals and/or children. [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] in particular proves herself to be extremely adept and mostly all tasks, barreling through them with ease. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] earns himself a small fortune with his gambling, and between the events of The Night™ is his gambling legends, has been granted the title "[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] of [[Brisay]]". [[DaVinci]] manages to find a middleground between the two, helping out the townsfolk while also doing some gambling on the side, evening out all his expenses. [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] preferred to keep to himself as he traversed the outskirts of town and the docks quite often. On one particular night, he notices a ship from the capital city visit port. During this, he hears many dark rumors about the city's black market allegedly gathering for a coup. Unfortunately, he does not get much more information than that as no one knows who the leaders are. And finally, [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] become fast friends and explore town together during the day, occasionally joining [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] on her adventures through the market stalls. While [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] spends most of her nights at the [[Salty Mermaid Inn|Inn]] talking to [[Astra]]. [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] spends her nights with [[Sister Nicole]], talking about Gods and other various things, while also discovering strange phenomenon across the town.

> Later, [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]], [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]], and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]], gather together as [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] struggles to choose a trinket she wants to purchase. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] discovers a large amount of tracks, suggesting a large group moving hastily out of the village and towards the cottage of [[Rowana Whitewind]]. [[DaVinci]], however, discovers an extremely rare flower called the Drooping Dragonjaw. It was revealed later by [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] that it was actually just a weed.
> After [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] chooses her trinket, the Tabaxi Dreamcatcher, [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] chooses to disclose a very disturbing poem that [[Sister Nicole]] gives her, with nothing more than a "not good" to warn her.
> [[The Long Patrol]] members, alongside their new recruits, meet back up in the tavern as [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] informs them, for most certainly not the first time, of her collection of trinkets and... rubbings. 
> [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] goes to [[Temple of The Weaver|temple]] and finds [[Anjali]] and [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] helping an acolyte named [[Markus Brightwood|Markus]] light some candles. After a questionable attempt to assist [[Anjali]] in accomplishing a task that specifically requires height, the trio are interrupted when another acolyte, [[Alara]], rushes in to inform [[Markus Brightwood|Markus]] that [[Kellen]] the Blacksmith has gone missing. After some talks of shady men in dark cloaks, the group decides to investigate what has happened.
> When they arrive, all three could immediately notice that the place was ransacked by intruders. Signs of a struggle, broken furniture, footprints scattered around, and even a piece of a torn cloak that seemed to match the dark cloaks [[Alara]] mentioned are found. They find a note addressed to [[Kellen]] telling him that it's not safe, and he needs to head North. Unfortunately, the scene takes an even darker turn when [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] finds an empty hidden compartment and splashes of blood across the couch...

## Log

Most awoke without any recollection of the night before, save for [[Anjali]] due to his large constitution.
[[Belohck]] receives a hefty bill regarding the drinks, food, and damages from the previous night.

> [!Info]- [[Vino Vangard|Vino's]] off time
> [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] spends most of their time mostly mingling with the clerics from the nearby temple. They manage to convince the clerics to allow them to read from the [[Deck of Dynarths]], however most seem to brush it off.
> 
> During the night, [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] reads the fortunes of travelers in return for coin. Despite his reaction during his first reading, [[DaVinci]] finds himself going to [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] quite often to inquire about Fate and what it means for him.
> 
> [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] ends up being extremely successful with her readings and becomes quite popular in town.
> > [!Success] Vino earns 12GP for her services

> [!Info]- [[Anjali|Anjali's]] off time
> [[Anjali]] helps around town for little to no pay, with the sole purpose of helping others. This often results in him mainly putting things on high shelves and other such tall-people tasks.
> 
> At night, [[Anjali]] spends most his nights studying the stars. While they often frequented the docks or the [[Temple of The Weaver|temple grounds]], he found that Northern Pasture provided the best view of the sky.
> 
> Notices the classic constellation, [[Found Constellations#Fucking Iguanas|Fucking Iguanas]], but a new one as well, called the [[Found Constellations#Scorpion|Scorpion]]. This is found in towards the Southwest and is known for the bright star marking the stinger on its tail.
> 
> One night, [[Anjali]] notices a set of track of kobolds leading out of town, noticing it is a two-toed kobold named Stephen. He returns to town to discuss the tracks with [[Astra]] and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]].
> 
> [[Anjali]] turns out to be good at foraging and finding berries for the hungry children and folks. One one particular occasion when handing out berries to folks, [[Anjali]] is told a rumor about the [[Singing Cave]]. A hidden cave along the coast that emits a beautiful, haunting melody at dusk. Potentially inhabited by a spirit of a once renowned singer. Kids often go to try and find it, however it is known not to go near the cave because it can incur the wrath of the spirit. ^SingingCave

> [!Info]- [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]], [[DaVinci]], and [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie's]] off time
> [[The Long Patrol]] members continue to try and find new members, but don't have much luck. They continue to help around town, doing various good deeds here and there.
> 
> [[DaVinci]] and [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] were largely unsuccessful with dealing with various trapped animals, however [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] proved herself adept with one cat in particular by drawing on cat ears to convince the cat she was friendly.
> When a child was stuck between barrel staves, [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] hangs back to allow [[DaVinci]] and [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] to do the leg work. Once again [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] proves herself exceptional by displaying massive feats of strength in tearing the entire stave off and destroying the barrel, all while leaving the child unharmed.
> 
> At day, the members helped around town, and at night, they partied almost to a legendary level, creating new stories to be passed on amongst the villagers.
> > [!Success] [[DaVinci]] gambles and earns enough gold to cover all living and food expenses.
>
> > [!Success] [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] earns a small fortune of 140GP via gambling and granting him the legend and title of "[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] of [[Brisay]]".
>
> > [!Success] [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] also manages to cover their expenses using their winnings.
> 
> As [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] wanders the markets of [[Brisay]], she stops at some stalls with items that catch her eye. She finds a broken magical compass; a small ornate compass with a slot in the center that seems it can hold something. The compass could have been created before before the [[Severance]]. It has a delicate engraving of Stars and constellations. In addition, she finds a gadget created by the goblins, a Genasi elemental stone imbued with elemental magic that can change color based on the elemental energy it contains (mood ring, lol), a gnomish mechanical pocket watch with a hidden compartment, and a Tabaxi dream catcher said to capture bad dreams and bring good ones. The dream catcher, being of Tabaxi make, has travelled far to reach Brisay.
> > [!Important] [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] chooses the Tabaxi Dream Catcher

> [!Info]- [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus's]] off time
> [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] spends time in the outskirts of town, trying to avoid attention. They spend their days in quiet contemplation. The sea is always capturing his imagination as he finds himself often listening to waves near the docks.
> 
> [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] speaks to one of the fisherman at the docks who fills him in on a rumor. According to many fisherman there's a hidden stash of pirate gold buried in/near the village. Children are often trying to find a map along the beach, while the wives whisper that old [[Captain Barrow]], who now lives as a recluse near the docks, might know the secret of the location, but he refuses to admit it.
> 
> One day, [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] finds himself at the docks and spots a large ship with crimson flags and dark golden sails. [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] recognizes the masthead of the ship (open dragon mouth) and realizes it is the lead scout ship among the warships of [[Deloran]], with the emblem of the King on the sails.
> News of the capital city rumors that the city's black market is planning a coup to overthrow the current government. Leaders of the underworld and allegedly gathering allies in pursuit of a new prosperity of [[Deloran]]. The ship is being called the Black Market Coup. Despite its leaders being unknown, the movement is gathering momentum.

> [!Info]- [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] and [[Dex Elderflower|Dex's]] time off
> [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] and [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] explore town together and become friends. The spend most of their days together, however they split up at night.
> 
> [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] tends to prefer the quiet comfiness of the inn, becoming good friends with [[Astra]]. She often notices [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] running around with new trinkets and souvenirs she has bought, exclaiming that this has been one of the best towns she's been in. [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] shows [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] around very enthusiastically, showing her all of their favorite location.
> 
> [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] spends time with [[Sister Nicole]] as they talk about Gods and other stuff. They also talk about strange rumors going around town; carvings on trees, symbols laid out in basements, whispers of a dark spectre. [[Sister Nicole]] leaves [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] with the following advice:

*LM Note: [00:30:18] Timestamp - funny ensues*

The party meets back up as [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] takes [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] to her next favorite tourist spot. [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] gets frustrated as she has a hard time making a decision on what to get.
[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]], with all her dwarven stone mason knowledge roll to <font color=20B2AA>**Investigate**</font> the Genasi gem.
> [!Fail] [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] rolls a 1.

> [!Quote] "I want the compass, but it's broken, I'M BROKEN"
> - [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]]

[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] gets real dark exclaiming to [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] that she's going to watch her friends die and homes burn. She then decides to choose the Tabaxi Dreamcatcher to help with her PTSD nightmares.

> [!Quote] Conversation between [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]]
> "Where would you like to go?" - [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]]
> "Ummm.." - [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]]
> "I shouldn't have asked you." - [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]]
> "Now I'm upset" - [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]]

> [!Quote] Yet another conversation between [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]]
> "What's all that water running down your face?" - [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]]
> "These are called *tears*, Hattie." - [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]]

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] and [[DaVinci]] talk and decide that it's time to start patrolling the long while throwing shade at how they think [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] is "strange" and hope she's not terrorizing the new recruits.

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] notices a large amount of tracks leading away from the village, heading Northeast from the North Pasture. Based off the evidence from the tracks, he determines that it was not only a large group, but one that was moving very quickly. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] recognizes that direction leads towards a cottage in the woods where an older woman lives, named [[Rowana Whitewind]].

As [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] is investigating, [[DaVinci]] notices a pretty flower and it distracts him. He thinks it's a rare flower named the **Drooping Dragonjaw** *(he's wrong)*. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] takes a look and realizes it's a weed. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] thinks someone is in need of help and they set off to find the other members.

[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] recalls that [[Sister Nicole]] and them went into a cookware store and "shit was weird".
There were pots in a circle with a stone that matched a stone [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] had in the center.
*LM Note: I have no idea what stone they're talking about*
[[Sister Nicole]] then gives [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] a [[Poem from Sister Nicole|poem]] that makes them feel bad.
They walk into the market and find [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]].
> [!Quote] "I'm not good in my head"
> - [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]]

*LM Note: Listen to the recording [00:45:07]*

![[Poem from Sister Nicole]]

[[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] thinks she's haunted by a demon.
[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] seems to think that [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] is talking about their actual sister, rather than a Sister of the temple.
The three discuss what the [[Poem from Sister Nicole|poem]] means.
*LM Note: No really, listen to the recording for this bit*

---

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] walks up the hill towards the temple. Runs into [[Anjali]] who is helping an [[Markus Brightwood|acolyte]] light some candles that are up high.
[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]], determined to be helpful, asks if he, a dwarf, can help light the final candle.
[[Anjali]], touched by [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus']] determination despite obvious setbacks in regards to the particular task, picks up [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] and holds him up high so he can light the candle.
*LM Note: Go to [00:54:38] in the recording for this scene, it's pretty funny*

> [!quote] "The church of the no-ladder-day saints because we have Anjali"
> Charlie (not Brusay), in response to who the temple worships.

> [!Quote] "It's a non-demon agreement, an NDA"
> - Charlie (not Brusay), back at it again

[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] decides it's time for a reading, and pulls [[Deck of Dynarths|cards]] for [[Anjali]].
- [[The Nameless Gods]]: The gods are everywhere.
	*[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] informs [[Anjali]] that he stepped on one earlier which is now causing a crises as he tries to avoid stepping on them from now on.*
- [[The Smith]]: Strength and discipline. Helps mortals to control things.
- [[Eldath]]: The goddess of peace, seeks peace and not power.

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] also agrees to have his [[Deck of Dynarths|cards]] read:
- [[Tyr]]: The god of justice.
	*[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] fails to hide his scorn from [[Vino Vangard|Vino]].*
- [[The Yeoman]]: Hard work and labor.
- [[Cyric]]: The god of death and deception.

The three share a drink together after the reading.
While drinking, they notice a [[Alara|female acolyte]] running up frantically. She reaches [[Markus Brightwood]], stating that [[Kellen]] the [[Alara|Blacksmith]] is gone and tries to pull him inside the temple.

[[Anjali]] hands [[Alara]] a goodberry to help calm her down and convinces them to tell the group their story. [[Kellen]] has disappeared with his home looking ransacked. Men in dark cloaks were found around his home prior to the disappearance.

While they tried to hide the information at first, [[Anjali]] overhears that [[Alara]] thinks this event is related to the rumors from [[Knossen]], a town to the South. After getting permission from [[Markus Brightwood|Markus]], she explains that magic leaving the world created a lot of fear, and in that fear people needed answers. Some people were willing to do anything to get the answers they wanted. There are some folks in [[Knossen]] who might be tempted to dabble in darker magics; to make a pact to bring magic back to their town. Magic is much older than the Gods, they're not the only ones that hold the Weave. **Ripping the weave could have released many ancient things once sealed.**

The three head over to the [[Alara|Blacksmith]]'s house while the acolytes head back into the temple.

---

All [[The Long Patrol|Long Patrol]] members have met back up in the tavern, recruits included.
*LM Note: Listen to recording [01:21:00] - I don't think I could do this segment justice in typing it out. Probably will get to that later.*

---

Back at the [[Alara|Blacksmith]]'s house:

[[Anjali]] finds signs of struggle, broken furniture, flipped plates and cups, a meal still warm (on the ground). Footprints of boots scattered across the floor, towards the fireplace, up the stairs, to an old desk that has been ripped open and searched through. In the stack of papers, he finds a letter addressed to the blacksmith saying "[[Brisay]] is no longer safe, you must travel North". 

[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] finds much the same, noticing more damage and even a splash of blood across the red couch. They also notice a loose brick by the fireplace. After pulling the brick loose, the hidden compartment was found empty. She tasted the blood trying to gleam more information, but fails.

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] notices the same things as the others, but also finds the torn cloth of a black travel cloak. [[Anjali]] notices that this particular cloak is an extremely old cloak that is well worn, likely traveling through the Veil during the season of summer. Likely from the North.

The group wraps up the investigation and decides to head back to the Inn to tell them about what they found.
