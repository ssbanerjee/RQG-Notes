> [!Summary] Session Summary
> The group meets up in the [[Salty Mermaid Inn|Inn]] to discuss their findings of the day. [[Anjali]] not-so-discretely announces that the [[Alara|Blacksmith]] is missing and likely in danger due to the blood found in their ransacked home. [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] convinces [[Anjali]] to keep quiet and calms the room down.
> After some discussion about what to do, the group is unable to come to a conclusion. [[Leerial Windwhisper]], the owner of the [[Salty Mermaid Inn|Salty Mermaid]], steps into the conversation after overhearing about the events of the [[Alara|Blacksmith]]'s house and the rumors of [[Knossen]]. They inform the group that they're way in over their heads to be talking about such topics, saying they should leave this to the professionals. Some inquiry with [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]] has revealed that the main force of [[The Long Patrol]] likely already know about the situation.
> [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]] then proposes a different path and asks the group to take care of some Kobolds nearby that have been hovering around the Northern Pasture. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] gets [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]] to sign a contract obligating her to pay everyone 50sp per Kobold ear returned. [[The Long Patrol]] members, [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]], [[Vino Vangard|Vino]], and [[Anjali]] all agree to work together to deal with the issue.
> *Side note: [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] has a private "conversation" with [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]] after everyone goes to sleep ;)*
> After the group gathers supplies, they set off for the Kobold cave. When they find it, [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] accidentally trips, smashing her staff across the trees as she fell, exclaiming "Oh no, my walking stick!!!" Luckily, the Kobolds on guard are as observant as a sack of rocks and think the noises were made by a strange bird, and head back inside their cave.
> [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] then has the group split, sending in the "stealth" group first, consisting of the new recruits/children, lead by [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]]. Then, this group is followed by the ranger group ([[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]), covered by the melee group. [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] and [[Anjali]] are against this plan of attempting to sneak into the cave and sending the children first, however they eventually relent. Unfortunately, the plan to stealth into the cave in broad daylight backfires as the stealth group is ambushed by the Kobolds who saw them enter the cave, starting a fight.

## Log

*[[DaVinci]] decides to turn in for the evening and will be out of this session.*

[[Anjali]], [[Vino Vangard|Vino]], and [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] head back to the [[Salty Mermaid Inn]] after making their discoveries.
Due to [[The Tripalium]] ending, most people have funneled out of [[Brisay]] at this point, so the Inns have been relatively empty now.

The owner of the [[Salty Mermaid Inn|Salty Mermaid]], [[Leerial Windwhisper]], is in.

[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] orders her Nectar of the Gods.
[[Anjali]] heads straight to [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] to inform him of their findings, whom he finds lost in thought.
[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] goes to the bar on his own.
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] are hanging around the fire, alongside [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] and [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]].
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] is making some weird faces at the [[Poem from Sister Nicole|poem]].

[[Anjali]] speaks loudly to [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] and informs him that [[Kellen]] has disappeared.
[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] tells [[Anjali]] to keep it quiet and he changes to a loud whisper.
As he attempts to tell the [[The Long Patrol]] about what they found, [[Anjali]] calls [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] over to show them the cloak that they found.

[[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] grabs the cloak for a second, but [[Anjali]] doesn't even notice and grabs it from her to show to [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]].
"We have the finest sheep in the South." - [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]]
[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] asks if she can tear a part of the cloth for her collection.
[[Astra]] comes by with drinks and implies [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] to prevent [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] from performing another "rubbing".

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] says that this is not an issue for [[The Long Patrol]].
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] tries to say that the dark cloak is related to the [[Poem from Sister Nicole|poem]] she got.

The poem reminds [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] of a fairy tail told in his youth. A dark story serving as a warning to those venturing out in the world. White primroses growing at feet is a warning to those who seek great power for that power can call forth the great darkness. And in that darkness, lies madness.

[[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]] steps into the group's circle as they hear about the poem and beckons the group over to the a tale to talk.
They mention how the group is stepping into dark matters that they do not understand.

[00:37:02]

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] announces [[Rowana Whitewind]] is probably dead, however [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]] says that she is travelling and likely still safe. She also states that the dangers at [[Knossen]] are likely far more dangerous than what the group can handle.

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] suddenly announces the King's fleet was here and inquires if it's related to [[The Long Patrol]] being spread thin trying to handle things. He decides not to reveal what he learned outside that the ship took some damage. [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]] knows that he's hiding information and brings it out of him, which results in [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] spilling the beans about the Black Market Coup.

It seems [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] was unaware of the Coup and the dangers to the King. [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] announces that the [[Deck of Dynarths|cards]] say the King is destined for death, much to [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]]'s amusement. She then asks [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] what he feels about the King, but he responds in Elvish "It's not polite to speak politics in mixed company". [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] and [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] once again immediately announces they heard what he said.

[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] says she's down to kill all kobolds. And she'll skin them all and drain their blood. [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]], despite very concerned, states that she will pay 50sp for every Kobold ear we bring back.

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] lets slip that apparently [[Belohck]] has not been returning his letters, throwing the the deal that [[The Long Patrol]] is paying the bills into question.

After some deliberation, the group agrees to hunt the Kobolds and enters under contract with [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]].

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] mentions to [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]] that he wants to talk alone with her after the others go to bed.

~~[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] tries to bang [[Leerial Windwhisper|Leerial]]~~

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] orders 3 drinks for the two of them before they begin to talk politics.
They have a hidden conversation.

---

Some ships from the North have arrived in town and the markets are well stocked.
After the group makes their necessary purchases for the journey, they venture out of town towards the Kobolds.

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] expertly navigates the group through the woods to find the kobold cave.
He signals the group to hold and everyone crouches, however [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] trips, makes a lot of noise, bangs their walking stick across a bunch of trees and exclaims "Oh no my walking stick!!!".

Fortunately, the kobolds that were standing outside the cave are extraordinarily dense and think "oh, funny bird" and go back inside after mentioning the name Stephen.

[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] tries to discern information about the cave formation: "That's a nice boulder."
[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] concocts a plan to have a stealth group sneak in, backed by a ranger group, with the melee group covering the ranger group.

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] voices concerns about attempting to "sneak" into a cave with a single entrance in broad daylight. In addition, [[Anjali]] is not happy about the idea of sending in children first and questions [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]'s judgement. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] states that [[The Long Patrol]] recruit all sorts of folks, even young ones, and whether they die or not is up to them.

*(While this is happening, [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]]'s eyes start to glitter different colors, for some reason)*

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] is fairly adamant about the plan and [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] manages to intimidate [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] into following orders. [[Anjali]] agrees to go along for the sake of moving things along.

The stealth group of [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]], [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]], and [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] go into the cave first.
They find an empty cave, save for a crude statue of a dragon made out of mud, sticks, and rocks. On the floor, there is a large carving of a diamond. Around the statue [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] can see disturbed ground.

A twig snaps and the group turns around to see a group of Kobolds surrounding them.
