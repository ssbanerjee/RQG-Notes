## Log

The long patrol members approach the [[Salty Mermaid Inn]].
[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] enters first, noticing the door with carvings of the kraken, deepshark, and other mythical creatures of the sea.
Inside, they notice a painting of a somewhat risquÃ© mermaid holding a cocktail.
[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] is memorized by the door, much to [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] and [[DaVinci]]'s dismay as they want to get inside. She takes particular notice to the seafolk and delicate carvings.
[[DaVinci]] and [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] are uninterested and head inside without her.
[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] walks in first on what could be described as a party and is excited by the prospect of easy targets.
~~[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] has his dick out with [[DaVinci]], they're getting very excited.~~
[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] notice the [[The Long Patrol|Long Patrol]] members walk in as they are quite boisterous, with [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] taking particular notice to [[DaVinci]].
[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] doesn't immediately notice her, but does recognize that there is a young person in a setting that would not normally support such a individual.
The Long Patrol members go to the bar, and try to read the room for a good candidate.
> [!Fail] [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] rolls a 13, doesn't get a good read.

> [!Fail] [[DaVinci]] rolls a 5, doesn't know how to read.

[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] notices the large windmill which towers over the village's small homes.
> [!Fail] [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] rolls to make sure they make it to the [[Salty Mermaid Inn|inn]], rolled a 4.
> They immediately take a wrong turn and get lost.

They find themselves back at the [[Night's Watch]] and they inform her on where to go.
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] walks by the [[Whispering Tides Inn]], but it is quiet.
They find a guidestone that is etched in Common; a prayer to the fields given to [[The Yeoman]].
> [!Quote] "Hard labor, simple life, sharp blade, softer."

[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] wholly uninterested.
They reach the North Pasture, and then eventually make it to the [[Salty Mermaid Inn|Salty Mermaid]].
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] immediately wants a shower and reaches out to the staff, finding [[Astra]] (white and gold scales).
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] speaks to [[Astra]] in Draconic and asks where to take a shower.
[[Astra]] informs [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] that they can talk to them later, and guides them over to the fire by [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]].
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] asks [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] what they do, to which they respond that they're from [[Loradriel]] and are traveling around looking for history on magic.
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] is ecstatic as they are also looking for magic and says they won't reveal why, but then immediately states it's because of their family.

The summer air in [[Brisay]] carries the smell of the sea.
Despite good beginnings, [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] and [[Anjali]] travel in silence.
[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] explains about wine per [[Anjali]]'s inquiry and calls it the "Nectar of the Gods".
> [!Success] [[Anjali]] rolls a unnatural 20 on a CON save for alcohol tolerance.

[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] states [[The Warden]] is speaking through [[Anjali]].
The two approach the main street along the harbor of [[Brisay]] and see the sign on the [[Salty Mermaid Inn]].
> [!Quote] "WE NEED THE NECTAR OF THE GODS"
> - [[Vino Vangard|Vino]]

They first notice [[The Long Patrol#Player Members|Long Patrol members]].
[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] doesn't seem to enjoy their presence, however [[Anjali]] is unaware of who they are.
[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] notices the tattoos on [[Vino Vangard|Vino]], but is unaware of the intricacies of their tattoos.
[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] says they should get more drinks, [[DaVinci]] is on board.
> [!Quote] "You only YOLO once"
> - [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]]

> [!Quote] "You're talking to me like I'm nothing, I put that in my brain book"
> - [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]]

> [!Quote] "You're a fucking private! Do you want to be digging trenches for the rest of your fucking life?"
> - [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] talking to [[DaVinci]]

[[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]] is all about that LIVE LAUGH LOVE.
[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] meets up with [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] and tries to recruit them
> [!Quote] "Light is Long, Light is Right"
> - [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]

> [!Quote] "There is no law, unless we are here to take the law"
> - [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]

*\*LM Note: Just listen to the recording and pray you understand what's happening.*

A strong hand rests on [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]'s shoulder.
He looks up and sees a rugged, imposing individual, with a faint tan, and two small tusks from lower jaw.

> [!Quote] "Peace favor your blade, son"
> - Half-Orc server

> [!Success] [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] rolls Perception, 15.
> It is a being of roughly the same height, tan skin, small tusks from lower jaw, left tusk is pierced with golden ring, septum piercing on nose, orcish traits. A Half-Orc that is not trying to be threatening.

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] complements the Half-Orc, saying he's always happy to see one and appreciates their ability to drink. They then try to flag a bartender down to get a drink for the two of them, until the Half-Orc, confused, says that he can take the order instead as he picks up the empty glasses at the table.

> [!Info] [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] orders a round on the bar on them.
> Costs them 3GP. The server rings a giant bell in response to notify the bar.

> [!Quote] "You never know what the tides bring in; a coin, a drink, a new friend."
> Half-Orc server

> [!Fail] [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] appreciates the gesture and offers a toast and tries to persuade the [[Salty Mermaid Inn|inn]] itself to pay the whole tab. Rolls a 5 and fails.
> *\*LM Note: While this is happening, someone (I think Charlie) is continuously banging the table chanting "Bruce, Bruce, Bruce" and I'm honestly just confused.*

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] jumps on a table and addresses the bar:
> [!Quote] "It is not the Gods who pay for drinks tonight. It is [[The Long Patrol]]. [[DaVinci]], [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]], and myself. From us to you, [[The Long Patrol]] needs recruits."
> - [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]

> [!Quote] "Don't vote for me, BELIEVE in me!"
> - [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]

> [!Quote] "We have a generic man that is kind of a loser ([[Dex Elderflower|Dex]])!"
> - [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]

*\*LM Note: Go to 1:03:26 in the recording for pure chaos*
*1:03:50 also has the most comical "something definitely just broke" noise I've ever heard in our recordings*

[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] calls for a halt and asks [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] to sit down.
> [!Quote] "The man speaks from the heart. The man speaks as the God [[Tyr]] speaks through our man to inspire us all to find peace within.. To find the harmony within. And now we need to embrace the Nectar of the Gods."
> - [[Vino Vangard|Vino]]

> [!Quote] "Fuck [[Tyr]]."
> - [[DaVinci]]

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] who believes in [[Tyr]] is offended.
The entire group comes closer to witness the argument between them.
> [!Quote] "Fuck your fucking God."
> - [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]]

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] and [[DaVinci]] argue about [[Tyr]].
[[DaVinci]] argues why are there negative things if [[Tyr]] is all powerful.
> [!Quote] "Fuck [[Tyr]], and fuck the light."
> - [[DaVinci]]

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] agrees.

[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] interrupts and believes it is important to have a reading of the [[Deck of Dynarths]].
> [!Success] [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]], [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]], and [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] roll for knowledge of the [[Deck of Dynarths|deck]] and succeed.
> No one else passes.

> [!Quote] "Deck of Douchenaria"
> - [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]]

[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] picks cards for [[DaVinci]]:
- Primary card: [[The Dragonlords]], who are known for being ones that want to find vengeance.
- Secondary card: [[Nerull]], the God of Fate of [[The Old Gods]]. This means that their life is not forfeit for the God has many plans for them.
- Final card: [[The Weaver]], the God of Fate for [[The New Gods]]. Showing that [[DaVinci]]'s life is heavily controlled by fate itself.
[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] believes the [[Deck of Dynarths]] is for charlatans.
[[DaVinci]] does not believe in the readings.

[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] tries to convince [[DaVinci]] that they do not need to believe in their current fate and ruler being [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]. [[DaVinci]] is not persuaded.
[[Vino Vangard|Vino]] states that the [[Deck of Dynarths]] when they are first read for you speak to what controls your life, even if you do not accept it at the moment.

[[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] mutters under their breath in Dwarvish that he believes it all to be a bunch of bullshit.
[[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] immediately announces what [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] said to the group.
They don't believe it makes sense to *not* believe in Gods.

*\*LM Note: idk what's happening anymore, go to the recording*

[[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]]'s ultimate goal is to search for ways to help and eventually lead his people back to [[Belohck]]. They seek to do good in the world and make it better.

> [!Warning] [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] and [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] agree to join [[The Long Patrol]]
> However, [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] deceives [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] and doesn't say the oath in full.

> [!Important] [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] announces the oath to join [[The Long Patrol]]
