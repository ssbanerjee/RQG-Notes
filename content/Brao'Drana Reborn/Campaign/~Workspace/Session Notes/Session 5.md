## Log

([[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] only): finds book; "The [[Archive In-Between]]".
Escapes Eugene's understanding mostly.
Main thing he gathers is a sense that the archive in between is this place between worlds that is rumored to be true.
"Traveling" outside of this plane.

He's being watched by a tall lanky man. Grabs cheap vase, sleight of hands the vase to the ground, blends in with the crowd that gathers, slips away successfully. Sneaks up on the man watching him and sits down to talk. [[Eldroin]]; the tower is his life's work by filling it with knowledge. [[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] gets a letter from him; a start to a new adventure. Dangerous? "Dance among the stars". Reads the letter.

[[Eugene's Letter|Letter]] found and delivered to him by a friend, thinks it's the start of a great adventure.
Transcription of a letter found by a contemporary in the search of the arcane/mystical.
Long lost tome he uncovered, point you in a direction.

Object letter points you can take you to the archive in-between, and allow you dance among the stars.
Won't shape the world, but will find your next time and lead you to the dangers of the world (probs).

(Yenna only): Getting some fun chest action. Steals dagger.
[[Whistle Hopfoot]] comes up to ask what we want.
Bards to perform for free food.
[[Yenna]] agrees to give me the dagger she stole so I can improve it.
[[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] comes back, approaches Kira about a dwarven city called [[Bal'Darim]]
[[Kira]]: "Let's get a pep in our foot"
[[Yenna]]: "I was just trying to get his dagger, iykwim ;)"
