> [!Summary] Session Summary
> Two years have passed since the unfortunate events at the [[B04 - Goblin Camp|goblin camp]] off the road to [[Berea]]. Due to scrutiny being thrown at [[The Long Patrol]] for allowing such a tragedy to happen, the faction has been struggling to find new members as of late. [[DaVinci]], [[Hattie Thornborne|Hattie]], and [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock]] are members of [[The Long Patrol]] that have returned from an unsuccessful trip to [[The Tripalium]] at [[Whiteshore]]. They find themselves in the harbor town of [[Brisay]]. [[Lt. Buckminster Brusay d'Babincock|Brusay]] decides the group should head to the [[Salty Mermaid Inn]] to "find easy targets" for recruitment. Elsewhere, by a [[Temple on a Hill]] near the town, [[Vino Vangard|Vino]], a follower of [[Deck of Dynarths|Dynarths]], follows her Deck to [[Anjali]], whom she finds staring at the stars. After a brief conversation with a [[Middle aged woman|middle aged woman]] from the Temple, [[Vino Vangard|Vino]] states that [[The Weaver]] is now guiding her and [[Anjali]] to the [[Salty Mermaid Inn]]. Inside the Inn, [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] and [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]] primarily keep to themselves. A tall dragonborn named [[Astra]] wargs [[Sephirah Dieldiran|Sephirah]] of strange going-ons in the area, in particular the fact that kobolds have been harassing the farmers of the North Pasture, but no one knows why yet. [[Occisus Verus Amare|Tacetus]], 15 drinks in and inspired by an incredible concoction of [[Pippin Gearspark]], lumbers over to a group of dwarves (+1 human) and converses with them. Finally, Dex, barrelling in from the north, covered in grime and earth, catches the eye of the [[Night's Watch]] stationed up there. After some talks of the Gods with [[Sister Nicole]], [[Dex Elderflower|Dex]] decides to head over to the [[Salty Mermaid Inn]] to turn in for the night. Now we head over to the Inn as we find all our various adventurers gathering together for the first time.
