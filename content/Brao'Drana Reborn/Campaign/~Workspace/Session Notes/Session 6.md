> [!Summary] Session Summary
The group gathers for breakfast and meets a new party member, [[Thorvald Einarsson|Thorvald]]. Before departing for [[Berea]], a large, [[Old gnomish woman|older gnomish woman]] stops the group to chastise them about their decision to travel through the Narrow. [[Yenna]], however, cuts off the woman and tells her the advise is not wanted. Raven leaves a note to apologize for their behavior, and then the group takes off. Rain slowing down their travels, they eventually come across a hooded figure running towards the group. This figure is being chased by a large group of giant spiders. During the [[B03 - Giant Spiders|fight]], [[Kira]] seems to [[Kira#New Abilities|have magically sparked a fire]], but denies she had anything to do with it. In the confusion of battle, Yenna attempts to attack the hooded figure, but fails to do so. After rescuing them, the figure reveals themselves to be a red-haired elf, hailing from a ship called the HMS Jackie Datonna.

## Log
Conduit for God - Spud
We meet Thorvald and I give Yenna the improved dagger.
At the same time, I have improved my own leather. The battle with the birds showed me that extra protection is necessary for this journey.
Older gnomish woman stopped us from leaving. She seems very stern.
Seems to be upset that new recruits are taking us through the Narrows.
"Keep your eyes open, the rain hides many secrets".
I left a note for Pebble apologizing to the older gnome.

--
The rain has slowed down our travels.
A hooded figure runs towards us, giant spiders trailing behind.
In the fight, I threw a bottle of grease with the intent of lighting it on fire. However, Kira, inexplicably managed to set it on fire from afar. Like magic.
Red haired elf, young -but weathered, sailor tattoos all around.
The elf ran from cages and Yenna is extremely upset with him. She seems to have dropped into a new accent as well, calling the elf scum.
Eugene has stepped in to try and de-escalate.
Lar comes in and starts to intimidate the man even further.
Spud steps in as well and takes the elf, Eugene, and Drew to the side.
The elf opens up more to Spud after being with calmer people and getting food and water.
The elf came in on Fuzzleknuckles' ship from [[Berea]] (HMS Jackie Datonna).
