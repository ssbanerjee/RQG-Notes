## Description
A craftsman expert of all trades, Raven is the son of two masters of their craft.
His mother, a sorceress before the Severance, and his father a carpenter coming from a long line of tradesmen. His father's line is filled with blacksmiths, stonemasons, carpenters, and other such craftsman.

Growing up with stories of magic long gone from his mother, Raven became fascinated with the concept of the types of accomplishments that could be obtained via magic. In order to satiate his curiosity, and also to give his mother a spark of the magic she once had, Raven has devoted his life to replicating the effects of magic via mechanical means, using his knowledge of various crafts from his family.
