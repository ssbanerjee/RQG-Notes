## Description
Extremely large for a human, Anjali is a hulking man with long, messy hair. He has a large body of an even mixture of fat and muscle, covered partly with a mixture of hide and leather armor, leaving most of his stomach exposed. Armed with a wooden shield and staff, he lacks the ability to shape shift into animals, unlike most druids.

Anjali has lived most of his life in the wilds, mostly in seclusion. With no one to guide him, he often as looked to the stars for information and guidance. He has great survival skills and is extremely perceptive. However, due to his seclusion, he is very ignorant of the world and lacks the common knowledge expected of most people. 

###### Key Notes:
- Unable to change forms into animals like most druids, but instead adopts a [[Anjali#Starry Form|Starry Form]].
- While not a particular tanky individual, their preference for shields and armor gives them an off-tank role in a party.
- While he does not know the public name of them, or that they're quite an entity itself, his beliefs of the world align with that of the **Nameless Gods**

###### Strengths:
- Very wise and perceptive
- Despite their lack of general knowledge, they show a great deal of common sense

###### Weaknesses:
- Seclusion has made him ignorant of what most would consider common knowledge.

###### Relationships:
-

## Starry Form

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.

## Constellations

##### Archer
A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within <font color=FF7F50>**60 feet**</font> of you. On a hit, the attack deals <font color=FF7F50>**radiant damage**</font> equal to `dice: 1d8`+ your <font color=9370DB>**Wisdom**</font> modifier. ^aDesc

## Star Map
You’ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding this map, you have these benefits:

- You know the <font color=FF7F50>**guidance**</font> cantrip.
- You have the <font color=FF7F50>**guiding bolt**</font> spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can have prepared.
- You can cast guiding bolt <font color=FF7F50>**without expending a spell slot**</font>. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish <font color=FF7F50>**a long rest**</font>.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.
