## Description

In the heart of [[Brisay]], the **Salty Mermaid Inn** stands tall and grand. Its walls are adorned with exquisite mosaics depicting legendary sea creatures, and its windows boast stained glass in aquatic hues, filtering the sunlight into a kaleidoscope of colors. The inn is a sanctuary for weary travelers, providing a comforting ambiance with the soft whispers of waves lulling guests to sleep at night.

This is where the group meets in [[Session 9]].
