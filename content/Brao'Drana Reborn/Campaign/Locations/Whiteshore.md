## Description

Situated on the coast at the mouth of the Tyodan River, Whiteshore is a fortified town that, were it not for its own petty, internal squabbles, might wield more influence among its fellows in the vale. Currently, it is most remarkable for its barge-building operation (and that industryâ€™s importance to the commerce of other settlements) and its annual fairs.
