## Description

The majestic Dwarven fortified city, carved into the heart of the towering mountains like a jewel amidst the stone. Surrounded by colossal stone walls rising high, adorned with intricate Dwarven runes and imposing statues of legendary heroes. The gates, forged from the finest metals, stands strong, a testament to the Dwarven craftsmanship that created it.
