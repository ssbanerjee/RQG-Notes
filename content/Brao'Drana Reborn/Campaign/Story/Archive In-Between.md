A book that [Eugene] finds in the [[Temple of the Nine]].
While the true meaning of the book escapes his understanding, the primary aspect of the book is that it describes a place in between worlds that is rumored to be true. It talks about "traveling" outside of this plane [^1].

A [letter] given to Eugene [^1] describes the potential location of the Archive In-Between, which is believed to point you to the location of the [[Fallen Star]].
