A letter given to [[Eugene Marchent|Eugene]] by Eldroin[^1].

Addressed to Nihavalor (sp??) 
Based on what I managed to unearth regarding the monastery of the arch sky, I'm glad it's you climbing down into those ruins and not me.
Here's the surviving transcript of what I recovered from M.B.
I'll send along the map fragment as well, hopefully it will help you more than its former owner.
I could only make out segments.
	"[...] could be a great haul of loot if even half the rumors are true. Rumor came from a trapper who knew a bandit who stumbled on the camp when fleeing from an owlbear in the forest around Bal'Darim."
	"[...] said he knew something about it. Some Temple of The Broken Sky watchers from way back when. Said to fill their ways with traps to hide a treasure more valuable than anything you've ever seen. The only kind in the world [...] said it was savvy to the stars and sky and rumored to point to things beyond the veil [...]"
	"[...] temple is right near the coast where dragon bones can sometimes be found after a gale. Old sandstone walls with ancient carvings barely touched by the wind and rain. The way in isn't but rubble, looks like we can dig in [...]"
If what I suspect is true, this temple could in fact be a key to uncovering the whereabouts of the Fallen Star.
I await your discoveries eagerly back in Whiteshore, and hope to see you in my tower again soon.

May the wind guide you,
Sendril.
