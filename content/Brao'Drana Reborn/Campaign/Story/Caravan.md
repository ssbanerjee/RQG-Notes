This caravan consists of the following individuals:
- [[Raven Eléfont]]

- [[Larimar Laguna]]
- [[Yenna]]
- [[Drew Saint Werd]]

And is guarded by the following two recruits of the Long Patrol:
- [[Eugene Marchent]]

> This has led to great complains with the Long Patrol on assigning irresponsible recruits as guards for civilians with no senior authority for backup.
