The caravan consists of individuals on their way to Whiteshore participate in the Hiring Fair[^1].

This caravan consists of the following individuals:
- [[Raven El√©font]]
- [[Spudris Shadowsong]]
- [[Larimar Laguna]]
- [[Yenna]]
- [[Drew Saint Werd]]

And is guarded by the following two recruits of the Long Patrol:
- [[Eugene Marchent]]
- [[Kira]]

Unfortunately, due to rash decisions made to enter a goblin camp unprepared, the majority of the caravan have died in battle[^2]. This has led to great complains with the Long Patrol on assigning irresponsible recruits as guards for civilians with no senior authority for backup[^3].
