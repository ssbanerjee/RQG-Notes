When the wild God arrives at the door, you will probably fear him.
He reminds you of something dark, that you might have dreamt,
or the secret you do not wish to be shared.

He will not rap on the door,
instead he scrapes his fingers leaving blood along the walls.
Though primroses grow in circles around his feet.
