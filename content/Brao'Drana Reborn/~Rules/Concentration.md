Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its <font color=FF7F50>**Duration**</font> entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:
- <font color=FF7F50>**Casting another spell that requires concentration.**</font> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
- <font color=FF7F50>**Taking damage.**</font> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a <font color=F0E68C>**Constitution**</font> saving throw to maintain your concentration. <font color=FF7F50>**The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher.**</font> If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for <font color=FF7F50>**each source of damage**</font>.
- <font color=FF7F50>**Being incapacitated or killed.**</font> You lose concentration on a spell if you are [[Status Conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]] or if you die.

The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a <font color=F0E68C>**DC 10 Constitution**</font> saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.
