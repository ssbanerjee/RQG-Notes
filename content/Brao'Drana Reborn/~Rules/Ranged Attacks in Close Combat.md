> Ranged spell attacks do not suffer this penalty if targeting the hostile creature within 5 feet. <font color=B22222>**Disadvantage**</font> is still applied if targeting a separate creature outside of this range and there is a hostile creature within 5 feet.

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have <font color=B22222>**disadvantage**</font> on the attack roll if you are **within 5 feet** of a hostile creature who can see you and who isnâ€™t incapacitated.
