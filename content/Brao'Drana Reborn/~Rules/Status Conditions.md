## Exhaustion
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. [[Status Conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | <font color=B22222>**Disadvantage**</font> on <font color=FF7F50>**ability checks**</font>                                               |

| 5     | Speed reduced to 0                                                                                                                       |
| 6     | Death                                                                                                                                    |
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has <font color=B22222>**disadvantage**</font> on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.  

Finishing a <font color=FF7F50>**long rest**</font> reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1.
