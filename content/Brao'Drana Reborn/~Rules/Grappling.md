When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the <font color=FF7F50>**Attack action**</font> to make a special melee attack, a [[Status Conditions#Grappled|grapple]]. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the <font color=FF7F50>**Attack action**</font> action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be <font color=FF7F50>**no more than one size larger than you**</font> and <font color=FF7F50>**must be within your reach**</font>. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a <font color=FF8C00>**Strength (Athletics)**</font> check contested by **the** target’s <font color=FF8C00>**Strength (Athletics)**</font> or <font color=228B22>**Dexterity (Acrobatics)**</font> check (the target chooses the ability to use).
You succeed automatically if the target is [[Status Conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]].
If you succeed, you subject the target to the [[Status Conditions#Grappled|grappled]] condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

##### Escaping a Grapple
A [[Status Conditions#Grappled|grappled]] creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a <font color=FF8C00>**Strength (Athletics)**</font> or <font color=228B22>**Dexterity (Acrobatics)**</font> check contested by your <font color=FF8C00>**Strength (Athletics)**</font> check.

##### Moving a Grappled Creature
When you move, you can drag or carry the [[Status Conditions#Grappled|grappled]] creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.
